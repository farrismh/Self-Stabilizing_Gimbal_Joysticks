To address the challenge of stabilizing motion-based systems while allowing manual control, a dual-joystick gimbal setup is developed. The system enables users to adjust roll and pitch angles smoothly while maintaining overall stability, which is essential for tasks like camera tracking, robotic movement, and remote-controlled platforms.  
By integrating two joysticks, the design supports intuitive multi-axis control, giving users direct input over orientation without sacrificing system balance. The concept of joystick control is based on research involving motion-matching controllers used in drone systems. These studies showed that traditional joystick setups can be difficult to operate due to poor alignment between user input and system response. By improving the coordination between joystick signals and gimbal motion, the system aims to offer a more intuitive and responsive control experience. 
To enhance stabilization, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was implemented with Kalman Filtering to best correct for sensor noise from the IMU. The filter was implemented in MATLAB and compared with the Complementary Filter method. Filter constants were tuned to reduce sensor noise and improve angle estimation, resulting in smoother and more reliable motion tracking. 

II. INTRODUCTION 

A. Background 

THE objective of this project, as outlined in the Abstract section, is to design a compact, low-cost, and real-time self-stabilizing gimbal system that integrates IMU with the extra functionality of a manual joystick control input using Arduino IDE. 
In recent years, motion-controlled systems have become an essential part of robotics and mechatronics, enabling more natural and precise ways to control devices such as drones, robotic arms, and camera gimbals. Traditional joystick-based control methods, while effective, often require the user to mentally translate two-dimensional joystick motion into three-dimensional system movement. This can reduce intuitiveness and increase operator workload, particularly for users with limited experience in multi-axis control [1]. Developing systems that align physical user movement with the corresponding mechanical response has therefore become a growing area of research in intuitive control interfaces. 
Recent studies explored how motion-matching controllers improve usability by linking the user’s hand orientation directly to the device’s motion [2]. Their research compared conventional joystick controllers with a motion-matching prototype and found that users achieved higher success rates, shorter task times, and fewer collisions, especially in first-person-view (FPV) operation. These findings highlight that mapping the physical motion of the operator to the controlled system reduces reference-frame misalignment and enhances user intuition. 
Tne key problem identified in the study is the reference-frame misalignment, such as the illustration in Fig. 2., where the user’s intended motion and the device’s actual motion differ due to perspective changes [2]. For example, when a drone rotates, the pilot must mentally adjust directions to align the joystick inputs with the drone’s new orientation. This cognitive effort often leads to control errors. By contrast, a motion-matching controller directly couples the controller’s orientation to the drone’s orientation, allowing for more natural, body-based control inputs. 
Inspired by this concept, the project aims to develop a gimbal control system that integrates two joysticks for added functionality and precision. The gimbal provides stable three-axis motion for pitch, roll, and yaw control, while the joysticks offer additional inputs for speed adjustment and directional fine-tuning. This hybrid design allows the user to experience both intuitive motion-matching control and accurate manual input, and therefore, can be a flexible prototype for various mechatronic applications like a camera stabilizer on drones, unmanned vehicle control, etc.
